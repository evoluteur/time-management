# Time Management

This project is a serie of interactive animations to illustrate how you are spending your time. It is based on the conference on time management and work-life balance "[The Power of the Hourglass](https://laurentpellet.com/le-pouvoir-du-sablier/)" by [Laurent Pellet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurent-pellet-france/).
